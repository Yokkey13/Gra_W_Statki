# Gra_W_Statki (eng. Battleship)
It's a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
Assumptions:
  Program is operating on board 30x30.
  The number of individual types of ships has to be configurable (2-5 masts).
  Mechanisms:
  Manual ship positioning (horizontally, vertically, from a given ship starting point).
  Automatic ship placement.
  Verification of the ship's alignment (aut / manual) - ships cannot go beyond the board or touch their sides.
  Presentation of the board alternately for 2 users (opposite sides).
You can play player vs player (PvP), player vs computer (PvPC) or computer vs computer (PCvPC).
